# Data Science Exercises
In this repository, I present some of my experiences in the fields of data science and data analysis. Each Jupiter notebook is a project with its own dataset and goal.

## Data Analysis
- supermart_grocery_sales.ipynb : fictional dataset from keggle.

## Classification
- phone_classification_dataset.ipynb : Several models from scikit-learn (sklearn) are used to obtain a suitable model for this dataset. 
- mnist_classification.ipynb : Image classification task solved with CNN using pytorch.
